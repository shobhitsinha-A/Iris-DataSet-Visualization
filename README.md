# Iris-DataSet-Visualization
The Iris dataset contains 4 numerical attributes (4 measures) i.e., sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width and one predictive attribute i.e., species (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, Iris Virginica). The 4 numerical attributes can be used to predict the species of the flower that has been classified into three species. 
I have used Tableau to plot various relationship within the features provided to us from the dataset.
